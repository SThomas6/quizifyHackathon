This is what the database would have looked like ideally:


Database Structure:
    - User registry:
        - Columns:
            - id - auto incrmented (Has to be unique) (Unique id does not exist in json, I think?! so probably doesn't apply)
            - username (Has to be unique)
            - password
            - status of account (user or moderator)
            - id of quizzes taken (taken from the Quizzes database)
            - scores and results for each quiz
    
    - Quizzes:
        - Columns:
            - id - autoincrement Unique (Unique id does not exist in json, I think?! so probably doesn't apply)
            - title 
            - description
            - category
            - difficulty
